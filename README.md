[MESHER]
- able to generate the mesh and coverting it as necessary.
[FEM-Engine]
- applying physical parameters and forcess through a terminal. which also opens the mesh assigning references in order to help out in the forces assignment

[SOLVER]
- being able to apply different solvers 

[OUTPUT-FILE]
- being able to output the files

[OVERALL]
Make a script that through a terminal, is able to:
- assign the nodes
- then the segmentes or arc
- then physical properties/thickness if necessary
- then boundaries and forces
- automatic meshing (choose paraemters and show finess)
- select solvers
- print out the files to visualize results.
